# Singulink.Cryptography.PasswordChecker

## Overview

**Singulink.Cryptography.PasswordChecker** uses algorithms similar to a dictionary attack password generator but in reverse - instead of generating passwords, it using matching rules to check if the password follows a predictable pattern with commonly used and contextual password words. This makes it easy to detect passwords that are vulnerable to simple dictionary attacks and follow the latest NIST password guidelines, giving your users lots of flexibility when choosing their passwords while still protecting them (without having to actually generate and maintain an actual password dictionary).
