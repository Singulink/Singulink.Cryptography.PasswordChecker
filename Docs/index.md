# Singulink.Cryptography.PasswordChecker

## Overview

**Password Checker** is kind of like a dictionary attack password generator but in reverse - instead of generating passwords, it uses a composable matcher system and algorithms similar to password generators to check if the password follows a common password pattern with the most commonly used password words/phrases that dictionary attacks use to generate passwords, taking into account contextual information like your app/service name and the user's information (name, email address, etc). This makes it easy to detect passwords that are vulnerable to simple dynamic dictionary attacks and follow the latest [NIST password guidelines](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b/passwords/), giving your users lots of flexibility when choosing their passwords while still protecting them, without having to maintain a specialized password dictionary.
